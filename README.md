# parity_cube_assessment

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started ðŸš€


To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
flutter run
```


## INFO
I have tried to cover most of the functionality as listed in the documentation for the assessment few knits and bits have been left out due to time constraints

Test have also been for the remote api client even though they are not passing now they were when there was only single data source class.

Needed some more time to write the integration and widget test.
